# **MLib** 
MLib is a simple template C++ library for Matrix operations.

## Incentive

The motivation behind this project is purely educational. <br/> 
I wanted to learn how to write and build C++ libraries with CMake.<br/> 
Additionally I needed to improve my understanding of linear algebra and matrices.<br/> 

## Operations
List of implemented operations:
 - Addition
 - Multiplication
 - Transposition
 - LU factorization
 - Inverse
 - Determinant
 - Inserting and retrieving rows/columns  

## What's next?

Currently my plan is to:

1. Provide explicit template specializations for square matrices of size 2,3 and 4.
2. Implement vector class.
3. Increase the number of the test cases.
4. Improve the code quality.
